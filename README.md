# React-Currency-app
I developed a Currency Converter using React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, integrating real-time exchange rates via an API. It allows users to select currencies dynamically, enter an amount, and get instant conversions. The app features a responsive UI, real-time data fetching, and input validation for accuracy. ðŸš€
